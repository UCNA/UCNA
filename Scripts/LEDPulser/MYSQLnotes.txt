Trying to pick out runs where analysis ID is same in both 

mysql> SELECT start_run, n, value, err FROM analysis_runset, analysis_numbers WHERE analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id = analysis_numbers.analysis_runset_id AND analysis_numbers.name = "kurie_150-635" AND start_run =23113 AND end_run =23113;

SELECT analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id, gate_valve, afp, start_run, side, n, value, err FROM analysis_runset, analysis_numbers WHERE analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id = analysis_numbers.analysis_runset_id AND analysis_numbers.name = "kurie_150-635" AND start_run =23113;

 SELECT analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id, gate_valve, afp, start_run, side, n, value, err FROM analysis_runset, analysis_numbers WHERE analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id = analysis_numbers.analysis_runset_id AND analysis_numbers.name = "kurie_150-635" AND grouping='run'; 

All runs in “Kurie Plot” DB are grouped by octects, etc.  
SELECT start_run, end_run, grouping from analysis_runset, analysis_numbers WHERE analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id  = analysis_numbers.analysis_runset_id AND name = 'kurie_150-635';

Gate valve is always open for octets
 SELECT analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id, afp, start_run, side, n, value, err FROM analysis_runset, analysis_numbers WHERE analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id = analysis_numbers.analysis_runset_id AND analysis_numbers.name = "kurie_150-635" AND grouping='octet';

Create a query and dump to tmp file
SELECT analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id, afp, start_run, side, n, value, err FROM analysis_runset, analysis_numbers WHERE analysis_runset.analysis_runset_id = analysis_numbers.analysis_runset_id AND analysis_numbers.name = "kurie_150-635" AND grouping='octet' INTO OUTFILE '/tmp/testmysql.txt' FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' LINES TERMINATED BY '\n';
